# HigherLowerBot

My first bot implementation using the [Microsoft BotFramework](https://dev.botframework.com/).

The bot is a simple webgame where you guess if the number the bot is thinking of is higher or lower than 5.

## Usage

The minimum prerequisites to run this sample are:

The latest update of Visual Studio 2015, 2017. You can download the community version here for free.
The Bot Framework Emulator.

Start the bot in your Visual Studio IDE and connect to it with the Bot Emulator using "http://localhost:3978/api/messages".

For more information on how to build bots you can visit the official Bot Framework documentation here
